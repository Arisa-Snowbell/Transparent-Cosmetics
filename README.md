### **Information**
This is my first mod I've ever made for Minecraft, I've been making plugins before but I wanted to learn and experience modding too.  
So after some time trying to figure out how some things work with great help from other developers, I present.. my first mod!

This mod was made with PvE in mind and can be considered very over powered on PvP servers.  
So when adding this to a PvP server, make sure where you start with.

Transparent Cosmetics in a mod that adds transparent "gear" to your minecraft/modpack.  
This mod uses features from [Cosmetic-Armor](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cosmetic-armor-fabric "Cosmetic Armor") with [Curios](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios-fabric "Curios").

When the items from this mod are placed inside the cosmetic slots it will hide the armor you're wearing in your armor slots.  
So you can show of your skin without having to unequip your armor.

### **Help and Support**
For issues you can directly post your issues at the Github repository that you'll find under the tab "Source"  
I'll think about setting up a Discord server if I feel like doing that, for now I do not have a Discord server for mod support.
